Story: 
What was previously a lush forest, mysteriously became a desolate wasteland. No one is sure why, and little is known as to what event caused this. 
Very few explorers and adventurers that went to explore the area ever return. 
Those who do come back hysterically talk about some floating fortress at the center of wasteland that drew them in. 
Afterwards, the stories vary pretty largely among those who came back. 
Some talk about the fortress being the cause of wasteland, it just showed up out of nowhere and destroyed everything around it on impact, 
others talk about the fortress as a place of endless riches and everyone should try to make their way to the treasure inside. 
Regardless of what they say, it is generally agreed upon that these adventures have lost their minds due to their experience in the wasteland.

This is the beginning the of the story of one of these adventurers who made their way into the wasteland for the possibility of treasure and the being the first one to document the fortress.

What was completed:

Each of the objectives and the pathways to each of them was completed and easy to see/follow. Once you collect the first one, the pathway going to that collectable disappears, allowing you to focus on the next collectable and pathway which was color coordinated.

Fortress being inactive at first to being active when all of the collectables were collected works

UI works to give as much data as needed to know how to play the game

What was not able to be implemented:

The original plans for the pathways to each of the collectables were supposed to spawn after the previous one was collected. 
I could not find the way for the pathways to go from inactive to active properly without having to set each individual spotlight I used for the pathway to active from inactive.*

*Note: I eventually found a way, but by the time I figured out how to code it properly I did not have enough time to go in and rewrite the code to do so. But it works so I can’t really complain.

The materials I used for the fortress looks funny and I could not really find a good way to fix it without rebuilding the castle again.

I ran out of time to create a part for the fortress to sit on, so I just fit it into the story that the fortress just destroyed the earth below it and now just floats there where it first landed.

Originally wanted to have an interact key that the player would press to pick up the collectables when they were nearby. Instead I chose to have the player walk over them to pick them up instead
